  ## Description

  This week were challenged to be build an app that allows the user to create and organize a database that holds information on the structure of the company.

  ## Installation

  In order to install this app, the user must install the following npm packages: 
  * `inquirer`
  * `express`
  * `mysql`
  * `console.table` 
  Once these packages are installed along with their depencies the user must ensure that their start script is saved in their `package.json`. Once that is confirmed, the user can enter `npm start` on the command line and they are prompted with a menu of options to select from.

  Please see Demo below and link to see the app in action
